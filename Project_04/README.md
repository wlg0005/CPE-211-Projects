# Project-04
This program calculates the following values for projectile motion:\
- The time to reach the maximum height
- The time for the projectile to hit the ground
- The maximum height achieved
- The horizontal distance traveled

The initial velocity (m/s) and starting angle (degrees) are read from an input file provided by the user where the values are on the first and second line, respectively.
