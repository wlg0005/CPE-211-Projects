# Project-09
This program introduces working with one-dimensional arrays. The program reads floating point numbers from a user specified input file and stores them in the array. The first line of each input file contains the number of floating point numbers in the file, and then several floating point numbers (1 per line). The following functions are performed on the array:
* Sort numbers from low to high
* Find the average of the numbers
* Find the median value
* Find the variance

The calculated values are outputted to the terminal.
