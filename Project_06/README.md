# Project-06
This program takes user input for an input file. If the file opens successfully, the program reads every character (including tabs, spaces, and newlines) on a line-by-line basis. It then calculates the following statistics:
* The number of characters on a line that are letters
* The number of characters on a line that are digits
* The number of "other" characters that are neither a letter or digit
* The total number of characters

It outputs 5 columns to the console with the statistics about each line and then, after outputting all lines, it outputs a line indicating the percent of the total characters that each column represents.
