# Project-08
This program served as an introduction to the use of structures (structs). The program takes input for an input file which contains information (record) for each subscriber to a magazine. After reading each record, the program determines whether a subscribers' subscription has expired. If it is still active, the program continues to the next record, otherwise the information about the subscriber is written to the user specified output file.
