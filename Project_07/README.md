# Project-07
This program has functions for the following tasks:
* Approximating pi using the Monte Carlo Method
* Simulating the odds of a coin being flipped
* Simulating the odds of a 5-sided dice being rolled

It takes user input for a seed, which is the starting point for the random number generator, and then outputs a menu. Based off the user's menu choice, one of the three functions is performed. This continues until the user chooses the exit option.
